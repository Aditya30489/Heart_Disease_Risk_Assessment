**KNN_Model.pkl file**: the pickle has KNN model as parameter for Grid Search CV and the accuracy of the model be 99%.

**App.py**: App.py has code built for UI of the application which has sidebar for taking input of the users and to predict the Heart Disease.

**Heart.csv**: Heart.csv is a dataset downloaded from kaggle platform, which has 13 features in the dataset.

**They are**:

1) age

2) sex

3) chest pain type (4 values)

4) resting blood pressure

5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8) maximum heart rate achieved

9) exercise induced angina

10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11) the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

12) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect



**To Run the Application follow the below steps:**

Step 1. Download the **KNN_Model.pickle** file which contains KNN Model saved in the file.

Step 2. Download the **App_py** file which has streamlit code as UI in the application and localtunnel to run the streamlit code.

step 3. Download the **heart.csv** file for the dataset ( downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset )

step 4. Upload heart.csv, KNN_Model.pkl for implementation of App.py file.

step 5. You will get output as IP address and link. Open the link and paste the IP address for implementation of UI in the application.
